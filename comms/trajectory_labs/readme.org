* [[https://lu.ma/d16abkbh][AI Safety Thursdays - Formal Containment: Proof-Carrying Code and AI Safety]]
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
AI Safety attention has increasingly shifted toward “defense in depth”: a layered strategy of safeguards.

​In this context, today's event will have Quinn Dougherty leading us on an exploration of forgotten literature on proof-carrying code to leverage it in a prototype AI containment procedure, enabling a narrow form of enforceable safety.

​We'll look at preliminary experimental results, discuss strategic outlook, and cover when proof-carrying code and guaranteed-safe AI more broadly make sense.

​​​Event Schedule
- 6:00 to 6:45 - Networking and refreshments
- 6:45 to 8:00 - Main Presentation
- 8:00 to 9:00 - Breakout Discussions
