Write a program C that such that the following hoare triple is provable:
{% if metavariables %}forall ({{ metavariables }} : Int), {% endif %} \{ {{ precondition }} \} $C \{ {{ postcondition }} \}
{% if failed_attempts %}
You previously attempted the following solutions:
{{ failed_attempts }}
Note that it's possible a previously attempted imp program was right you just didn't find the proof within the allotted proof loop budget.
If you're sure that the hoare triple is true and that the imp syntax is correct, feel free to repeat an attempted program.
{% endif %}
