* Formal Containment Protocol
[[file:comms/lesswrong/images/frontierbox.png]]
We would like to put the AI in a box. We show how to create an /interface/ between the box and the world out of specifications in Lean. It is the AI's responsibility to provide a proof that its (restricted) output abides by the spec. See the draft whitepaper in ~./comms/whitepaper/main.pdf~
** Run prototype
Nix flake devShell or nix with direnv (self explanatory), or install ~uv~ and ~elan~ manually.

The precondition and postcondition you pass in must be valid Lean as it goes directly into the template.
